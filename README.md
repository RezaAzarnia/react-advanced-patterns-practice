# React Advanced Patterns Practice

This project is a hands-on practice repository for exploring advanced React concepts, designed to deepen understanding of tools and patterns such as React Router DOM, Redux, Redux Toolkit, Redux Persist, Compound Pattern, and TypeScript integration. Future plans include adding **React Query** for more efficient server-state management.

## Features

- **React Router DOM** for routing and lazy loading pages
- **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit** for efficient state management
- **Redux Persist** to maintain state across page reloads
- **Compound Pattern** to create reusable and flexible UI components
- **TypeScript** for enhanced type safety and better developer experience
- **React Query** *(coming soon)* for simplified and optimized data fetching

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-advanced-patterns-practice.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd react-advanced-patterns-practice
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
## Usage
 **Run the development server with:**

  ```bash
    npm run dev
   ```
This command starts the application on http://localhost:3000, and it will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

 ## Project Structure
1. **src/components** - Contains reusable UI components built using the Compound Pattern.
2. **src/pages** - Includes main application pages and routes.<br/>
3. **src/redux** - Manages the global state using Redux and Redux Toolkit.<br/>
4. **src/types** - TypeScript definitions and types for the project.
 
## Future Plans
This project will be extended to include React Query for server-state management, improving data fetching efficiency and providing caching capabilities.
